# restaurant-search
Single page app for restaurant search using react

Currently Filters, Results page (search again), and pages are non-functional and are a WIP.

The exercies currently support a simple search for a type of cuisine and display all restaurants provided in the API response. You may click on restaurant tiles to open a modal with more inspection information.

Design is created to match mocks as closely as possible.

To test:

Run 'npm install'

Run 'npm start'
